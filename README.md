For a given gene, how strongly is it expressed in a given cell type? Can I quantify this?
This repo contains the jupyter notebook with the code to address this question.

There are in total 9995 genes and 106762 individual cells detected in our [single cell RNA-seq dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01549-4).
